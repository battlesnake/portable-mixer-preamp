Problems

 * Power rails are asymmetric (-0.7V, +5.3V instead of ±3.0V)

 * Bad connection on Ch4 input from jack

 * No output from test boost preamp on Ch4 (maybe due to previous issues)

 * Move AC coupling capacitor to before input is forked to boost stage

Improvements

 * Increase AC coupling capacitors to 470nF

 * Move output resistors to before output coupling capacitors

 * Increase output coupling capacitors to 4.7μF

To get

 * Custom etched PCB

 * Switches (no toggles)

 * Pot knobs

 * Case

 * USB socket

 * More capacitors (get kits from RapidOnline)
